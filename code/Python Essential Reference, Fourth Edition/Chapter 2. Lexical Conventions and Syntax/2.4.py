# 2.4 String Literals

# String literals are used to specify a sequence of characters and defined by enclosing
# text in single('),double("),or triple('''or""") quotes.There is no semantic difference
# between quoting styles other than the requirement that you use the same type of quote to
# start and terminate a string.

# Single- and double-quoted strings must be defined on a single line, whereas triple-quoted
# strings can span multiple lines and include all of the enclosed formatting(that is,newlines,
# tabs,spaces,and so on).

# Adjacent strings (separated by white space,newline,or a line-continuation character) such as
# "hello" 'world' are concatenated to form a single string "helloworld".
