# Algorithm

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation

###1)Niklaus Wirth:

    Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs

###2)Time complexity:
In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.
